        <para>Default zoom behaviour for zooming to a selected point has
        changed: before it was keeping the current scale, now it zooms to the
        maximum scale (by default). The zoom scale for zooming to points can
        be changed on a per-layer level by assigning the
        <code>zoomToPointScale</code> property in
        <code>ClientLayerInfo</code>.</para>
