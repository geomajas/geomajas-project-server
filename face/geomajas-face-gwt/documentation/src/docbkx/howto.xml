    <title>How to set the size of feature attribute windows</title>

    <para>By default, the size of the feature attribute windows are determined
    automatically.</para>

    <para>If your features have a lot of attributes this may not be ideal. You
    can force the size of the feature attribute windows using the WidgetLayout
    class. Add something like the following in your GWT entrypoint
    class:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>public void onModuleLoad() {
    // force a fixed height to feature attribute windows,
    // preventing them from becoming too big
    WidgetLayout.featureAttributeWindowHeight = 
        Window.getClientHeight() - WidgetLayout.windowOffset * 4;
    WidgetLayout.featureAttributeWindowWidth = 470;
    ....
}
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

  <section>
    <title>How to assure something is done once the map is initialized</title>

    <para>When your application starts, you may need to wait until the map is
    initialized. For example, trying to read the available layers or access
    them only works once the map initialization is finished. To avoid the need
    to write boilerplate code, you can use the runWhenInitialzed method. For
    example, to apply certain bounds, you can use:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>final MapModel mapModel = mapWidget.getMapModel();
mapModel.runWhenInitialized(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        final Bbox initialBounds = new Bbox(mapModel.getMapInfo().getInitialBounds());
        mapModel.getMapView().applyBounds(initialBounds, ZoomOption.LEVEL_FIT);
    }
});
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>Note that this really only runs once. If the change needs to be
    applied each time the map is reconfigured (for example when the login
    token changes), then you should use addMapModelChangedHandler
    instead.</para>
