  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This plug-in provides extra utility widgets for the Geomajas GWT faces
  (both SmartGWT and PureGWT). These widgets are not necessarily GIS related.
  Examples are a Ribbon (office like toolbar), a Wizard, a file upload widget,
  etc.</para>

  <para>In order to know which widgets, are already present within this
  plug-in, visit the roadmap on the Geomajas issue tracker.</para>

  <caution>
    <remark>At this moment, all widgets are based upon the SmartGWT widget
    library, and are thus best used within the Geomajas SmartGWT
    face.</remark>
