  <para>The staticsecurity plugin allows you to define the policies which
  apply for certain users. The policies are statically defined in a XML file
  (hence the name). These policies can be linked to users which can also
  defined in the XML file or which are obtained through code (for example
  linking to a user database or LDAP store).</para>

  <para>This plugin also includes an example which adds a custom policy and
  makes that available in the SecurityContext.</para>
