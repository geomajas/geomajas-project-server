	  is made available as a JMX bean so you can access it using a tool like JConsole or VisualVM.</para>

  <para>The profiling information is gathered in several beans, each profiling a specific piece with combined
	  figures. You can also get figures for groups. The plugin gathers the number of invocations and total runtime.
