geoToolsDescription=<p>This sample shows a map with a GeoTools layer based on an embedded GeoDB table. \
Initially it should show practically the whole world.</p>\
<p>The default mouse scroll controller is present that allows you to zoom in and out. A \
 pan controller is installed to allow you to pan the map. Also the buttons in the \
 upper left corner of the map allow you to navigate.</p><p><b>Note also \
 that you are not allowed to zoom or pan beyond the world maximum bounds.</b></p> \
 <p>The toolbar has an editing control. After enabling this control, you are able \
 to edit existing and create new countries. The multipolygon editing sample has detailed instructions on editing.</p>
