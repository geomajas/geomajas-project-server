0=Unknown exception in Geomajas
-1=Test exception message with ${0} parameter
-2=Test exception message with $${0} parameter
-3=English only
TEST=translated
1=MaxExtent missing for map.
2=Layer ${0} has problematic CRS ${1}.
3=Layer ${0} has CRS ${1} with unknown authority code.
4=Could not create CRS transformer to transform geometries from layer to map coordinate system.
5=Attribute ${0} is unknown, known attributes are ${1}.
6=Layer ${0} not found.
7=Transformation from CRS ${0} to ${1} not possible.
8=Transformation of geometry to required CRS failed.
9=Vector layer ${0} not found. The layer either does not exist or does not implement VectorLayer.
10=User ${1} is not authorized to use the command ${0}.
11=Layer ${0} does not exist or is not visible for user ${1}.
12=Create of new feature not allowed for ${0}.
13=Update of feature ${0} not allowed for ${1}.
14=Delete of feature ${0} not allowed for ${1}.
15=saveAndUpdate requires features at the same index in old and new lists to match (have the same id), problem at index ${0}.
16=Pipeline ${0} is unknown, it was requested for layer ${1}.
17=Pipeline context is expected to have a suitable value for key ${0}, but it is missing.
18=Unexpected error occurred while converting object ${0}.
19=Raster layer ${0} not found. The layer either does not exist or does not implement RasterLayer.
20=Configuration cannot be reloaded, context is not an instance of ReconfigurableApplicationContext.
21=Application ${0} not found.
22=Map ${0} in application ${1} not found.
23=Problem decoding CRS for map ${0}.
24=Feature model problem while rendering feature.
25=Could not render, transformation failed.
26=The filter "${0}" cannot be parsed.
28=IOException while rendering document.
29=Expected attribute value.
30=Unexpected end of attribute.
31=No registered writer for ${0}.
32=Invalid shape file url ${0}.
33=Not a legal feature, does not implement the "Feature" interface ${0}.
34=Feature model problem.
35=Cannot create layer model for ${0}.
36=Unsupported renderer type ${0}.
37=Could not create new feature, FeatureType was not found.
38=Unexpected problem.
39=IOException in layer model.
40=Don't know how to create or update ${0}, class ${1} does not implement FeatureStore.
41=Don't know how to delete ${0}, class ${1} does not implement FeatureStore.
42=Feature with id ${0} could not be found.
43=Dimension mismatch.
44=Could not resolve ${0} for ${1}.
45=Could not get metadata for ${0}.
46=Could not configure session factory.
47=Failed to load ${0} with filter ${1}.
48=Attribute ${0} is not an object type.
49=Failed to set attributes for ${0}.
50=Getting attribute ${0} failed for ${1}.
51=Getting all attributes failed for ${0}.
52=Property ${0} is not of type Geometry.
53=Unexpected failure to create a POJO for entity ${0}.
54=Failed to set geometry for ${0}.
55=Cannot determine class for feature ${0}. You should not overwrite "toString()" for the feature.
56=Feature class ${0} not found.
57=Command ${0} not found, maybe you need to install the extension which contains it.
58=Not implemented.
59=Print template ${0} cannot be converted to XML.
60=Print template ${0} could not be persisted.
61=Merge result was not a normal polygon.
62=Parameter ${0} is required but not given.
63=Security credentials (token ${0}) missing or invalid.
64=Cannot convert geometry, type ${0} unknown.
65=Convert layer extent to map CRS ${1} failed for layer ${0}.
66=Pipeline ${0} for layer ${1} contains extensions for non-existing hooks.
67=Map ${0} uses mixed scale notations (x:y and z), which is not allowed. Maybe you should use 1:1 for scale 1.
68=Cannot parse geometry ${0}, invalid WKT expression.
69=Pipeline interceptor ${0} contains non-existing step ${1}.
70=Pipeline interceptor ${0} contains a fromStep which is after the toStep in the pipeline.
71=A pipeline definition for ${0} contains both a pipeline definition and a delegate pipeline. Only one of both should be used.
72=Pipeline interceptor nesting invalid, includes interceptor ${0}.
73=Filter ${0} cannot be evaluated for layer ${1}.
74=Plug-in dependencies not met: ${0}.
75=Invalid configuration, the plug-in with name ${0} has been declared twice. It is know both as version ${1} and ${2}. The plug-in name is either used by more than one plug-in or the plug-in is on the classpath more than once.
76=Invalid attribute name ${0} in layer ${1}.
77=Invalid value for parameter ${0}.
78=Invalid SLD ${0} for layer ${1}.
79=Invalid SLD UserStyle ${0}.
80=Style ${0} not found for layer ${1}.
81=Problem rendering legend graphic ${0}.
82=Resource ${0} not found.
83=Style rule ${0} not found for style ${1}.

85=Could not parse expression ${0} for layer ${1}.
86=Could not evaluate expression ${0} for layer ${1}.
87=Layer ${0} does not allow features with an empty geometry. You may want to set allowEmptyGeometries (careful about the security implications).
88=Layer ${0} is not correctly configured: ${1}.
89=Duplicate attribute name ${0} in layer ${1}, path ${2}.
90=Cannot parse number ${0} in SLD file.
91=Cannot parse number ${0} in SLD file for attribute ${1}.
92=Cannot create feature without geometry for layer ${0}. This can be caused by passing a null geometry, \
  security limitations or geometry attribute not having the editable capability.
